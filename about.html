        This project focuses on addressing the issue of healthcare inequality throughout the United States by analyzing data from three relations: overall ratings of hospitals across the country, US population by state and zip code, and US income by zip code. This project analyzed these different factors and how they impact healthcare quality throughout the country. As hospitals are funded by local taxpayer dollars, this project aims to analyze how local factors can impact hospital quality in low-income and high-income communities. These relations have been used to locate areas of the country that could benefit from hospital reform, as well as to locate areas which have highly rated hospitals. Areas with lower hospital ratings were compared to areas with higher hospital ratings. Hospitals are rated on a scale of one through five by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (CMD) Hospitals with low ratings are associated with higher death rates due to preventable measures such as infection and healthcare provider error. (O'Donnell, Jayne) Each zip code where a rated hospital exists is cross referenced with other relations to retrieve average gross income (AGI) and population for that given zip code.
